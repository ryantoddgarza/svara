# Svara

The Svara web application is the client-facing interface of the Svara project.

## Application

Being truly generative, musical motifs are not predetermined; user instantiation of the application defines parameters such as tempo, favored musical intervals, and random seeding. All musical processes occur in real time.

The visualization section of the app shows the user frequency and amplitude feedback as well as relevant information about the raga. For example, one of the rules of a raga is the _prahar_ or time of day in which it should be performed. The traditional system divides a day into eight equal parts beginning at 6 am and this application references the userâ€™s local time to make the appropriate selection.

Additional rules implemented in generating the piece are the ascending scale, an altered descending scale, primary character note, supporting character note, common melodic themes, and suggested rhythmic structure.

## Application features

The web player is an implementation example of the generative system. User initialization of the application defines parameters such as raga selection, musical motifs, tempo, and random seeding among others. All musical processes occur in real time.

The visualizer shows frequency and amplitude feedback as well as relevant information about the raga. Rules include the time of day appropriate for a particular raga, ascending scale, an altered descending scale, primary character note, supporting character note, common melodic themes, and suggested rhythmic structure.

## Develop

1. `npm install` - Install dependencies from the monorepo root.
2. `cd packages/svara-web-app` - Navigate to the web-app package.
3. `npm run develop` - Run Webpack and start the development server.

Do not edit any build files â€“ `/build`. They are generated by the build tools. The production build is part of the CI process; the `/build` folder is therefore included in the project's _.gitignore_.

# @svara/ui

Reusable UI components.

## Importing

```js
import { Component } from '@svara/ui' // ES6
```

## Develop

1. `npm install` - Install dependencies from the monorepo root.
2. `cd packages/svara-ui` - Navigate to the UI package.
3. `npm run build-watch` - Run Webpack and watch for file changes.

Do not edit any distribution files – `/dist` – as they are generated by the build tools.
